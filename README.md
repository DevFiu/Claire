## Gene Family Analysis

**Introduction**

A gene family is a group of genes that share a common ancestor. They usually have similar sequences, structures, and functions. Gene family analysis is an important research area in bioinformatics, and it can help us understand gene evolution and function.

**Goals of this project**

This project aims to provide a toolkit for gene family analysis. The toolkit will include the following functions:

* Gene family identification
* Gene family evolutionary analysis
* Gene family functional analysis

**How to use**

The toolkit will provide an easy-to-use command-line interface. Users can provide a gene sequence file or a genome database, and the toolkit will automatically complete gene family identification and analysis.

**Expected outcomes**

The toolkit will help researchers conduct gene family analysis and provide important information for the following studies:

* Gene evolutionary relationships
* Gene function
* Gene regulation

**Technical route**

The toolkit will use the following technologies:

* Sequence alignment
* Phylogenetic tree construction
* Gene functional annotation

**Project progress**

The project is currently under development and is expected to be released in November 2024.
